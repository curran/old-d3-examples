# Old D3 Examples

15GB Full Dataset Download ðŸ‘‰ https://d3-community-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/BlocksToDisk.zip

This is a dataset of source code files for old D3 examples. The examples were scraped from GitHub Gists, and used to be viewable in the `bl.ocks.org` site before it was taken down. These examples are still visible in an open source clone of that platform: https://blocks.roadtolarissa.com/ . Insired by earlier work in the [Blockbuilder Project](https://github.com/enjalot/blockbuilder).

The idea of making this available is that in the modern era of AI, this might be a great dataset for fine tuning AI models for D3 coding (albeit in an older style), or of interest for research purposes. Since the resultig scrape is around 15GB, this repo only contains the scripts required to produce it, in case you'd like to run it yourself to add users or get the latest and greatest.

[users-combined.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enjalot/blockbuilder-search-index/master/data/users-combined.csv) is from https://github.com/enjalot/blockbuilder-search-index/blob/master/data/users-combined.csv .
