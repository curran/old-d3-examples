# Old D3 Examples

This is a dataset of source code files for old D3 examples. The examples were scraped from GitHub Gists, and used to be viewable in the `bl.ocks.org` site before it was taken down. These examples are still visible in an open source clone of that platform: https://blocks.roadtolarissa.com/ . Insired by earlier work in the [Blockbuilder Project](https://github.com/enjalot/blockbuilder).

The idea of making this available is that in the modern era of AI, this might be a great dataset for fine tuning AI models for D3 coding (albeit in an older style), or of interest for research purposes.

[users-combined.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enjalot/blockbuilder-search-index/master/data/users-combined.csv) is from https://github.com/enjalot/blockbuilder-search-index/blob/master/data/users-combined.csv .
